# Tuple in Python: Check Element Existence

## ðŸŽ¯ Aim
To write a Python program that checks if the element `'n'` and the element `8` exist within a given tuple.

## ðŸ§  Algorithm
1. Define a tuple `x` with some letters and numbers.
2. Use the `in` operator to check if the string `'n'` exists within the tuple.
3. Use the `in` operator to check if the integer `8` exists within the tuple.
4. Print the results.

## ðŸ§¾ Program
tuplex = ("s", "8", "a", "v", "n", "g", "u", "r", "c", "e")
print("n" in tuplex)
print("8" in tuplex)
## Output

## Result
Thus, the program has been executed successfully.
